# Improving Sensitivity in TOF-MRA Segmentation using Sparse Labels and Deep Convolutional Neural Networks

Software and manual labels used for the paper **TODO**.

Raw TOF-MRA data were obtained from the MIDAS database (Bullitt, Smith, and Lin):  
https://www.insight-journal.org/midas/community/view/21 

Expert sparse labels are available from the [labels](./labels) folder.

General code for the project (e.g. file handling, CNN training, grading, ...) is within this folder. Code run to generate figures, tables and stats for the paper can be found within [paperCode](./paperCode).

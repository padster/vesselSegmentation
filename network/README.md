**Tensorflow model weights**

Provided are checkpoint files for the network used in the paper. The network provided is 9x9x9x1, used for predicting voxels based off just raw MRA intensities.

To load the network (built using cnn.buildNetwork9()), see tensorflow's checkpoint tutorials: https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/checkpoint
